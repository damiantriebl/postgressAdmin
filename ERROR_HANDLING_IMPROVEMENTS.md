# Error Handling Improvements - Task 9.2

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive error handling improvements implemented for the PostgreSQL Query Tool backend, focusing on enhanced error messages, structured logging, and graceful degradation for network issues.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Messages with Troubleshooting Hints

#### DatabaseError Enhancements
- **Contextual Error Information**: Each error now includes operation-specific troubleshooting hints
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Errors are presented with clear, actionable suggestions
- **Error Severity Levels**: Errors are categorized as Low, Medium, High, or Critical
- **Retry Suggestions**: Automatic detection of errors that can be retried

#### Error Context System
- **ErrorContext Struct**: Provides rich context for each error including:
  - Operation type (connect, execute_query, schema_inspection)
  - Network status (Healthy, Degraded, Unhealthy)
  - Retry count and suggestions
  - Connection and query information

#### PostgreSQL Error Code Mapping
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Maps all common PostgreSQL error codes to user-friendly messages
- **Specific Troubleshooting**: Each error code includes targeted suggestions:
  - `42601`: SQL syntax errors with common issues and solutions
  - `42501`: Permission denied with privilege requirements
  - `42P01`: Table not found with schema verification tips
  - `42703`: Column not found with case sensitivity notes
  - `23505`: Unique constraint violations with conflict resolution
  - `23503`: Foreign key violations with relationship guidance
  - `23502`: NOT NULL violations with required field identification
  - `08003/08006`: Connection issues with network troubleshooting
  - `57014`: Query timeouts with optimization suggestions
  - `25P02`: Transaction aborts with rollback guidance
  - `40001`: Serialization failures with concurrency advice

### 2. Structured Logging System

#### DatabaseLogger Implementation
- **JSON-Structured Logs**: All logs are stored in structured JSON format for easy parsing
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log rotation when files exceed 10MB
- **Daily Log Files**: Separate log files for each day (`database_YYYYMMDD.log`)
- **Log Directory**: Logs stored in system data directory (`~/.local/share/postgres-query-tool/logs/`)

#### Log Entry Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "target": "database.connection",
  "message": "Connection failed: connection refused",
  "operation": "connect",
  "duration_ms": 5000,
  "error_code": "08006",
  "connection_id": "conn_1705311045",
  "query_hash": "abc123..."
}
```

#### Logging Categories
- **Connection Operations**: All database connection attempts and failures
- **Query Execution**: SQL query execution with timing and result information
- **Schema Operations**: Table and column inspection operations
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error information with context

### 3. Network Health Monitoring

#### NetworkHealthChecker
- **Proactive Health Checks**: Monitors network connectivity before operations
- **TCP Connection Testing**: Tests basic connectivity to database host/port
- **Failure Tracking**: Tracks consecutive failures for graceful degradation
- **Status Classification**: Network status categorized as Healthy, Degraded, or Unhealthy

#### Graceful Degradation Features
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Retries failed operations with exponential backoff
- **Network Status Awareness**: Operations adapt based on network health
- **User Feedback**: Clear communication about network issues and suggested actions
- **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful handling when network is unavailable

### 4. Enhanced Connection Management

#### Connection Retry Logic
- **Configurable Retries**: Up to 3 retry attempts for connection failures
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1-second delays between retry attempts
- **Network Pre-check**: Validates network connectivity before attempting connection
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs each connection attempt with success/failure details

#### Connection Error Handling
- **Host/Port Extraction**: Automatic parsing of connection strings for network testing
- **TLS Configuration**: Enhanced SSL/TLS error handling with specific suggestions
- **Connection String Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Connection Testing**: Enhanced test_connection with detailed error reporting

### 5. Query Execution Improvements

#### QueryExecutor Enhancements
- **Execution Timing**: Precise timing of query execution
- **Error Context**: Rich error context for failed queries
- **Query Hashing**: MD5 hashing for query identification in logs
- **Result Logging**: Logs successful queries with performance metrics

#### Query Error Handling
- **Syntax Error Detection**: Enhanced SQL syntax error reporting
- **Permission Error Handling**: Detailed permission requirement information
- **Constraint Violation Guidance**: Specific advice for constraint violations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Query execution time tracking and logging

### 6. Frontend Integration

#### LogViewer Component
- **Real-time Log Display**: Shows logs in a user-friendly table format
- **Log Filtering**: Filter logs by level (All, Errors, Warnings, Info)
- **Log Summary**: Dashboard showing error counts and statistics
- **Log Export**: Export logs to JSON format for analysis
- **Log Management**: Clear logs and refresh functionality

#### Tauri Commands
- **get_logs**: Retrieve logs with optional limit
- **get_log_summary**: Get log statistics and summary
- **clear_logs**: Clear all log files
- **export_logs**: Export logs to JSON file

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```toml
dirs = "5.0"      # For system directory access
md5 = "0.7"       # For query hashing
```

### Key Files Modified/Created
- `src-tauri/src/database/logging.rs` - New structured logging system
- `src-tauri/src/database/error.rs` - Enhanced error handling
- `src-tauri/src/database/connection.rs` - Improved connection management
- `src-tauri/src/database/query_executor.rs` - Enhanced query execution
- `src-tauri/src/commands/logging.rs` - Log management commands
- `src/components/LogViewer.tsx` - Frontend log viewer component

### Error Flow Example
1. **User attempts connection** → NetworkHealthChecker validates connectivity
2. **Connection fails** → ErrorContext created with network status and suggestions
3. **Error logged** → Structured log entry created with full context
4. **User sees error** → Frontend displays user-friendly message with troubleshooting hints
5. **Logs available** → User can view detailed logs in LogViewer component
