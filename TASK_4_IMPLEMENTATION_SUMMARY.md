## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Custom `useConnectionProfiles` hook for data management
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Form Handling
- Controlled components with React state
- Real-time validation with error display
- Form reset and cleanup on submit/cancel
- Separate handling for create vs edit modes

### UI/UX Design
- Follows dark theme of existing application
- Responsive grid layout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Integration Points
- Integrates with existing ConnectionProfileService
- Uses established type definitions from database.ts
- Follows existing project structure and conventions
- Compatible with existing routing and navigation

## Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- Form validation tests
- Empty state handling

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- API documentation for props and types
- Feature descriptions and screenshots
- Integration guidelines

## Next Steps
This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Task 5: Connection testing and validation
- Task 6: Quick connection selector interface
- Task 14: Integration with existing query tool

The component is ready for integration into the main application and can be extended with additional features as needed for subsequent tasks.
